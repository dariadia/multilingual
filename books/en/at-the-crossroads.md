### Episode 1. At the Crossroads

#### Intro

There’s nothing special about you. 
You thought about it before but never realised with such clarity. The hundreds of you-s stare back. Same as you, a little different. Wrong hair, a darker eye colour, skinnier arms, or it can be that their favourite colour is green… 
You blink. They all look away, and you bite into your lip. You’ve been clenching your fists so tight, you no longer feel your bruised fingers. 
They hurry on. Did they see you? The thousands of mirrors thump and rattle. Some slip and shatter into the blazing greyish fog. The ground shakes, and it thunders again.
You cough on the burnt air. Ashes, dust and everything material bursts into particles and hurts your eyes. Your whole world crashes behind your back. Breathe. You throw yourself at the nearest mirror. Your fists hit the cold glass again and again. You’ve got so far. The last one of your world, you didn’t care where – ran as fast as you could to the split.
Other you-s don’t care. They don’t even hear you as you scream and beat against the unmoving glass.
“That won’t do it, kid.”
You jerk your head up and see a crooked man step out. He takes his wide-brimmed hat off and tosses it into the rubble. Then loosens his patched scarf so that it wouldn’t cover half of his face.
“Why so quiet suddenly?” croaks the man and throws away his tinted round glasses as well. His darker skin is wrinkled and scorched with scars. “They won’t let you through.” He nods at the mirrors. Some more shatter. The further ones disappear into the disintegrating particles of your world. “Not unless you are a card. Others must die when their world dies.”
You clench your teeth and stand up. “How do I get one?”
Thunder blurs the stranger’s voice as your eyes find his. Glowing blues with yellow slits for pupils. The rattle dies out, it’s still there – the ground shakes right under your feet – but for some reason, the stranger’s voice is all you can hear.
“You’re a sharp one, I see.” He huffs a laugh. “A survivor.” He leaps over as earth cracks in between you. Two arm’s length away. “You’re in luck, kid.” He smiles crookedly and reveals perfect sets of shark-like teeth. “I’ve wanted to give up mine. But it comes with a price.” 
You look back at what’s left of your world. At your bleeding hands and at the darkness rolling closer. Greyish burning air. Particles. More mirrors shatter. About twenty left. Nothingness but for the spot you are standing on.  
And then, there is this card. Whatever that is.
“I’m taking it.”
The stranger slides his gloved hand under his coat. You clench your teeth tighter and won’t stumble back. Wanted to, every feeling screaming to get away and run. Only you know too well there’s nowhere left to run. Nothingness licks at the heels of your sneakers.
The stranger’s arm disappears up to the elbow underneath his coat and into his chest. A rip, a clap, a faint glower, and he breaks into his sinister laughter once more. 
“When you take a card, you lose your soul.” The stranger’s eyes glow brighter. 
You feel the remains of your world creeping from under your feet. The last few mirrors slip. “But I’ll live… right?” Your eyes are on the only mirror left. Right behind the stranger. He can still back out of the deal and make it out alive, for what you know about loyalties. 
“Yeah. You get to live.” Slowly, he pulls out his hand, and something smoulders through his clenched fingers.
“Then I’m taking it!” you snap and pounce. The rough fabric cuts into your skin. You clench his arm and wrench the thing out from his fingers, almost pull it from him, clasped in between your palms. The stranger grasps your hands just in time.
But he doesn’t struggle to get it back. He sneers and hovers over you, his sharp teeth now so close to your face that you smell something rotten.
“Remember,” he whispers, “you lose your card, you don’t die. You crumble into dust, and poof goes the memory you’ve ever existed.” His eyes blaze a darker shade of blue. “You also get to remember the look in the eyes of the previous owner. Before evaporating.” He winks at you and closes your fingers around the card. “Ciao.” He lets go. “Won’t see you around.”
And with that, he… disappears. Thunder roars in your ears, the last of the ground cracks– Ashes slip through your fingers, hurt your scratched hands and stick to your stained clothes. A-a-ah! Dead man’s ashes – but you hear the rattle, and the last mirror starts slipping. You glance at the thing, a paper card, clenched in your fingers.
And jump. The last pieces of your world soar into nothingness behind your back.


Chapter 1
Ugh. Your head hurts. 
“We aren’t late? Are we late? Ow!” Somebody squeaks. She has such a high-pitched voice, what a bother! “Are we, are we?”
You grimace and open your eyes. It doesn’t help much, everything’s blurry. The pale skies blind you after all the darkness and smoke, and you wince at the piercing pain.
“Are we?” repeats the girl.
Shut up. Please? You clench your fists, and yet feel nothing. Your numb fingers bleed. You wriggle your foot a little, then tilt your head to the side. Hard ground touches your scratched skin, and you bite back a yelp. 
Lying on your back, you realise in a moment. You shut your eyes hard and then blink a few times to stay awake. Nausea hits.
“Curse,” groans the girl, and for a second you think you’ve heard another voice. “It’s already down!” she yells. “Bet Jansen had something to do with it!” A pause, and, “Of course! Who else? It’s always Jansen. … Yes, I hate him! He’s annoying and pokes his nose where it doesn’t belong. … No, that’s a good enough reason!”
She’s talking to someone, isn’t she? You groan silently and try to sit up. Pain shots through your head and down your spine. 
Finally, you manage to peek to the side. Greyish-white and ground. Nothing else but for the two blurry figures and a larger black dot.
You lie low and hold your breath. Memories flood in flashes. School. The horrid noise. Ground cracking. Your teacher tore up into particles right in front of your eyes… Well, you never liked the hag… Right? You swallow the sigh and keep silent. 
“And who the claws are you?!” 
Fuck.
“…” You can’t hear what the other says, just that her voice is gentle and soft.
“Who. Are. You,” grits the girl and jabs her shoe into your side.
“Ompf!” You force your eyes open. 
“Anya, you’re hurting them!”
“Shut– Ugh. Argh!” The girl throws her hands up and groans. 
You blink a few times before your vision finally focuses. Freckles. Ginger hair touches her shoulders. A yellow T-shirt. 
“No, Moon,” says the girl calmer to the other behind her. “I am not.”
Dark shorts. Stupid striped socks.
“B-but–”
“No, Moon,” she insists and scuffs her green sneaker against the ground. “Moon?”
“… yes, Sun,” concedes the gentle voice, and the redhead turns and glares back at you. “But please don’t hurt them.” 
That Sun girl glances over her shoulder and hmp-s. “Fine,” she groans and rolls her head back. “Whatever. I don’t care.”
“Ouch!”
Bet she kicks your shin just in case. 
“Sun.”
“Alright. For you.” Sun steps back, and you gasp.
Two same faces. Moon kneels next to you but still not close enough. She has to reach out to touch your arm. Shoulder-length silver hair and blue eyes. Warm fingers graze your skin. A pale dress. Striped socks?
You smile, and Sun darts forward and hovers over your head.
“What’s so funny?” she snaps and pokes your head with her sneaker.
“Sun!” 
“Oh, they’re fine, Moon, don’t tit.” 
Wait, silver hair? You blink, but Moon definitely has silver-white hair and same colour bright freckles as her twin. Ugh, why bother now? That stranger had yellow slits for pupils and shark teeth, and you suddenly care for a girl to have silver hair? Makes no sense. You shut your eyes, but the stranger’s smirk won’t go away. 
“Where did you come from?” asks Moon softly, and you feel her eyes trace your every scratch and bruise.
Dead man’s ashes on your hands. Dead world’s dust in your lungs. She can’t see all that, can she? You bolt to sit up, and nausea and pain wash over you. You gasp for breath but still suffocate. 
No matter what, you keep your fists clutched. If only you could remember why… It was something important, something you’d rather nobody saw.
“I… fell in through the… mirror,” you stumble on your words. Your mind races. 
The classroom shook. The sky darkened and split. You ran. On and on, towards whatever that was while your hometown evaporated. How did that stranger call you? A survivor, huh? 
But Sun is as oblivious to your musings as you are to her rambling.
“Mirror? Which mirror– ah, you mean the portal?” She pokes your head again, but this time lightly, and points at the mirror. “That’s a portal, you dumb-ass.” Shadows swirl inside the pitch blackness on the other side. “And your world’s down, you’re lucky to be out and not inside there.”
The mirror glowers an eerie shade– you yelp and tumble.
“Ta!” snickered Sun. “Chicken.” Moon gives her a look, and Sun groans. “Oh well, your parallel’s down,” she explains and gestures. Sun looks clearly annoyed, and yet carries on in her high-pitched voice. “Destroyed, disappeared, disintegrated into particles. No big deal. Your family’s kinda dead, but it’s more like they don’t exist anymore. Everyone you knew too. Like I said…” She pats Moon on the shoulder, wraps her arms around Moon and helps her to her feet. “No big deal.” Sun turns Moon away from you and ushers her on. “Happens.”
Dead. It might be the pain dulling that it starts to sink it. Dead. No boy who kept snatching your pencil case and tossing it around. No cranky neighbour’s dog that chewed your favourite sneakers. No parents. No rules, you are free to do whatever you want…? 
Dead. Dead. Dead.
Your skin tinges, so you raise your hand to your eyes. It doesn’t glow or shimmer, or anything magical for that matter. Bummer, sure. Blue and bleeding skin. There is nothing special about you.
“What card are you?” Moon whispers.
Card? Ow. That card! The stranger’s card! You jerk forward but stop the last moment. Trust no one. Even if Moon seems nice, her twin is an ass. 
“Survivor?” That’s what the stranger’s called you. For some reason, you can remember your family’s favourite was pie but can’t recall your own name.
“There’s no such card.” Moon shakes her head.
“Moon!” 
Well, you’ve missed the part where Sun strode off and now glares from there.
“I’m coming!” calls out Moon, tucks a loose strand of her silver hair behind her ear and hurries off. You watch them leave until their figures melt into the greyish horizon. 
Sun and Moon. Weird. Was your name any better? Finger by finger, you loosen the numb grip… Only your palm is empty. Any palm.
“Wha…” you cry out but hush yourself. Turn your palms upside-down and back up, check inside your hoodie’s torn sleeves and every pocket. 
The card’s gone.


Chapter 2
Thump. Thump!
Your heart races. You stare at the mirror– no, portal, you remind yourself as your hands still rummage through your clothes. The card’s gone, and, well, your whole world’s gone, but somehow that doesn’t bother you. Not yet. 
Nothingness stills on the other side. It’s just like that – plain nothing, a darker shade of grey than the rest of the place. You whirl your head around but see nothing as far as your eyes can see. Rocky ground and a greyish sky, the line between them blurs in the distance. 
You stagger to your feet and wobble closer to the portal. The surface feels cold under your fingertips, but then it tinges, and you yank your hand back. 
“Wha–” You shake your hand to get the sticky feeling off. Your fingers go through the glass, they go right through–
You stumble, then glance at the nothingness left of your world and take another step back. Maybe two more. Just in case.
Your whole world’s gone. Past life’s gone too, and now with the card, which might have been the only chance you had in the new world, gone…
“Uh, not now. Please. Please.” You shut your eyes and turn your back to the portal. It doesn’t help, you can still hear the nothingness – it has a hollow sound to it. You hug yourself, and your fingers roughly dig under your shoulder blades. “Please, you have this. You can do this.” In and out, you force a few deep breaths and hold on tighter. 
“Are you alright?” calls out a deep voice. 
“Yes!” you exclaim without thinking. “I’m fine.” And nearly choke on the words.
“We-ell,” drawls the man. “Hello, then. The name is Maze.” He sounds closer, and you jerk your head up. The large man stops in front of you, grins and stretches out his hand. An over-sweet odour hits your nose. “That is Maze Eaton Harper. At your service.” He winks. No pupils or irises, his eyes are entirely brown.
Yours snap back to his wide hand, then trace up the dark hairs to his elbow. Maze has tanned skin, wears a red and white checked shirt with rolled-up sleeves and towers over your with the broadest shoulders you’ve ever seen. 
“H-hi…” You loosen your hold on your own shoulders but won’t shake his hand. Glance at it, then up at Maze’s square face and carefully slicked hair, at his hand again–
In the end, Maze decides for you. “Nice to meet you,” he drawls his vowels and snatches your hand between his palms. “You are new around here, are you not?”
“Y-yeah.”
“I knew it,” Maze grins. “A new card?”
“Y-yeah?” Why is he calling you a card? You have a card. Or were supposed to have one, for how could a piece of cardboard slip through your clutched fingers? “Wait. You can feel that I have a card?”
Maze shrugs and finally lets go of your hand. “That and you fell through a portal. Only cards can do that.”
“Card. Yeah. Right.”
“Hm?” Maze taps you on the shoulder and points at the portal. “Was that your parallel?”
“I… lived there? What’s a parallel?”
“Hm.” Maze shakes his head and moves around you and closer to the portal. “I am afraid the whole dimension was too weak and fell through.” He taps the glass several times, then rubs his chin with short stubble. “Happens. A tragedy if you ask me, such a waste of lives.” Maze shakes his head and turns back to face you.
“… yeah.”
“Oh, pardon! 
Maze walks towards you and drapes his arm over your shoulder. The top of your head rests on his ribs. His odour gets worse, it’s sweet and reeks at the same time. Reminds you of some swamp flowers and green pond scum.
“You found the card, did you not?” asks Maze and shakes his head. “Nobody has ever explained it to you.”
You open your mouth but decide against it. Maze doesn’t notice anyway, as it turns out he isn’t expecting an answer in the first place.
“In short, billions of billions of, how to put it, worlds are similar to each other in some way.” He gestures and ushers you to walk on, away from the portal and into the open emptiness. “Say, you have world A similar to B, then B is similar to C, but C is not like A? Are you getting the picture?”
Hm. Seems not that hard, so you nod.
“Good,” grins Maze. “Now multiply. One such world we call a parallel, similar parallels go into one dimension. Dimensions fall into four realms, and then there’re also Limbo and the Crossroads. Some parallels grow weaker and fade. Sometimes the whole dimension disintegrates, but that takes some major disturbance to the timeline.”
You stop and glance over your shoulder. “Can’t we go back in time and fix them?” And suddenly the glassy surface fades, and in a second the portal shatters. Your breath hitches, and you look away. 
“No. Time is infinite.” Maze pats you on the back to keep going. “At least for every parallel, it goes on, and you cannot do anything about it.” 
You squint ahead, and yet everything looks the same: a greyish emptiness blurs with the ground on the horizon. 
“But cards can travel between parallels,” drawls Maze. “So steer clear of the paler ones. They would not care whether you are a card. If you are inside when they fade, you are a goner. Card or no card.”
Uh-huh. The stranger also warned not to let go of the card. Somehow, you’ve lost it and had not turned into dust. As yet? You shudder at the thought, and Maze must feel it too.
“Cheer up, you are ali-ive,” he sings and huffs a laugh. “That is a good start, would you not agree?”
Good? The stranger’s smug smirk as he turned into dust makes you doubt it. It’s now stuck in front of your eyes whenever you blink. Well, that and your school, classmates and neighbours evaporating with the whole town as you left them behind and ran towards the weird split in the sky.
“No homework,” you mumble and sigh. “Not having a room to clean also sounds, erm, good?”
“That is the spirit!” Maze guffaws and taps your shoulder again. Those are too heavy, but you do your best not to wince. “Now,” he leans in, and you wrinkle your nose, “which card are you?”
You look away. His brown eyes are too close, and it isn’t his breath that stinks. The smell seems to come from his very skin. Alien body odour? Were those two even aliens or some kind of magical fantasy creatures? Bet it’s rude to ask. This whole parallels and cards stuff is making your head spin. Maybe if you shut your eyes tight enough, when you open them everything will be gone. Hello, your room and ordinary life!
“Oh, I am the Judgement by the way,” Maze’s deep voice cuts through your thoughts. Good thing you’ve never stopped walking along his side, so he hasn’t noticed your lapse. “Do not appall, I do nothing scary.” He purses his lips. “On the contrary to the Black Emperor.”
“The Emperor?”
“The Black Emperor,” corrects Maze and barely hushes the growl that follows. “Well, the Black Emperor he calls himself and so started everyone else. He is a reversed card, you would want to stay away from those. Nasty. Cruel. The Black Emperor’s hobby is destroying parallels, that man takes evil to a whole new level.”
Ri-ight. As if whole worlds falling apart isn’t enough, now there was a man with powers to destroy them at his whim. 
“He is a monster–” Maze goes on but you can’t listen to him.
Pat. Pat. Pat.
You glance around. Only your eyes trace the surroundings as you keep your head still. A portal shimmers in the distance. The brim has a pale purple and silver glower to it, and the surface reflects something. A city? Could be, you are too far away to make out the fuzzy lines.
If you somehow still have the card, it will let you through, right? What do you have to lose anyway? Well, Maze’s swampy sweet odour for starters. But he’s trying to help you– why exactly would he want to help you, a total stranger? You’ve never trusted anyone this easily.
You squint to see the portal’s edges better. Compared to yours, this one looks stable. And there definitely is some kind of a purple and silver city on the other side, so…
“Alright,” you say and quickly duck from under Maze’s arm. He doesn’t react right away, and you’re already several steps ahead. “No walking around fading parallels,” you shout and don’t look back. Your eyes are only on the portal. “Better no going near unstable dimensions at all. No running into the Black Emperor or reversed cards, otherwise run for my life. Got it. Thanks, Maze!”
“Hey, wha–” the growing swoosh drowns out his words.
And with a crackling pop, you tumble out on the other side of the portal.
