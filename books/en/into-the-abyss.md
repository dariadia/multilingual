#### Intro. From the stranger’s last memories

He was braver. Always has been braver than me. We’ve been together for hundreds of years, and he still gave it all up. Just like that… Suppose it gets boring when you live over a thousand. I was only three hundred and something.

I didn’t know at first, thought he was joking. To give up your own card is sheer suicide. And then I thought that we needed some time apart, we did so in the past after all. 

But he was serious. My Magician. 

A pity I can’t recall his face anymore. I don’t even remember his name. This new Magician is different. Perhaps, Lars Jansen is the most prepared of us to have ever wielded a card. If not for his age, that is. Lars looks like a kid, but he trained him well. My previous Magician.

When I came to see him after some time, my Magician told me he’s picked up an heir. That he would give him his card when the time’s right. I laughed and agreed to give up mine as well. Still thought he was pulling my leg. My Magician showed me the mirror, it reflected a pale chubby ghost of a boy.

I laughed.

I… left.

I did love him.

And then one day I woke up to no memories of him. Maybe I cling to this last one because it includes the new Magician. The not my Magician…

Wish I’ve seen him one last time.

I’ve never been that brave, went to a fading parallel instead. Thought it would do the trick for me, I can’t give up the card myself. 

That’s still suicide, alright? You stay behind in a fading parallel, and you disintegrate with it. Then the card randomly floats into any other parallel. Someone will pick up mine…

Kiddo’s changed my mind. The last survivor. They remind me of myself.

So I am saving them.

“Ciao,” I tell them and wink. “Won’t see you around.”


### Chapter 1

This so-o-o wasn’t the plan.

“What have we even done to them?!” you yell and run. 

This neighbourhood is a dump. With narrow side-streets, sudden turns and run-down bridges. Trash bags, overturn trash bins and just trash are scattered everywhere.

“We are… huff… the… Untouchables…” Lars lags behind.

“What now?!” You glance back – those thugs are getting closer. 

“Untou… a… ch…”

“Forget it!” you snap and jump down the riverside. A shortcut. Cracked cement pieces clatter from under your feet, and you run across. All water’s long gone. “Fuck, Lars, just do something!”

“Over… there!” he points up the bridge and slows down.

“Huh?” 

Lars waves, and a shimmer sprints off his palms and towards you. You yelp – it circles around your waist and yanks you up into the air.

Thud!

“Ouch…” Face into the tiles. Wait, tiles? You jerk up to your hands and knees and whirl your head around.

“Uh…” Lars plumps down nearby. 

This place looks nicer, straight out of a sci-fi. Are you even in the same parallel? White tiles, glowing handrails, hey, they even have moving platforms and thick glass walls automatically open to let them through.
 Apparently, Lars has tossed you inside with one of those.

“You’re okay?” You wobble up to your feet and glance his way.

“Uh-huh…”

If he says so. You shrug and walk to the side. Those thugs howl and bump into each other below. Some swear at you, others are already picking up fights with each other– Sharp teeth at the backs' of their heads. Stitched up mouths on the front. You gulp and step back.

“What is this place?” 

Lars sits up and gasps for air. “Cups. 16 South… Degree over 1300… Probability line any.” 

Erm, alright? “And those…” you point down.

“The Unspeakables… And to them… we look like the Untouchables.” Lars pokes his lip, a blood drop forms in the corner. 

“Mouths. Right–”

Thud!

You jump around. Skateboard wheels whizz, and they swirl to a halt.

“Not bad, losers,” snickers that person. 

Oversized brown bomber jacket and a blue hoodie. Short bleached shorts. They look you up and down. Scratched and scarred legs with freckles, and their skin has a yellowish-mustard tint. 

“Not bad, huh.” They throw their hood back, and you notice the black fingerless gloves.

“H-hi?” squeaks Lars.

Ugh. You step back and bite back a scream. It’s a girl, alright, and she’s around your age. 

Breathe in, breathe out. 

And she’s not trying to attack you. She runs her fingers through her sandy hair. It’s an undercut, and the lower half is blue. She smirks. 

She might have the same messily stitched mouth as those thugs. 

“Hi, that’s Lars,” you gesture behind you–

“Untouchables don’t go down there.” The girl pounces, and you stumble back. Light blue eyes. An upturned nose. Her face is a hand away from yours but for a mere second. “You’ve picked up a wrong neighbourhood to hang out.” Her words sound from behind, and she clatters her sharp teeth. 

Yes, she has another mouth at the back of her head. Not that you’re desperately trying to ignore it.

“I… hey, Lars is the–”

Lars breathes in sharply and crawls behind you.

The girl snickers, “Losers.” She throws her skateboard down and hops on. That makes her a head taller, so she now looms over you. Has this odd, gooey feeling about her. “Trixx, or the Tower.” Ugh– She punches you in the chest. “And this is my home parallel. My neighbourhood.” She waves around and smirks. “My rules. Spooking pathetic losers like you is the best.”

So. She’s a card. The Tower.

Trixx wheels around and yells, “Oi, motherfuckers, bet you can’t catch me!” She shows fucks at some people in white uniforms, whirls– 

Lars shrieks, and you tumble to the ground. The bridge shakes. Trixx snickers and whirls around several more times, then jumps up the handrail and sprints off. She tosses her hood back over her head. 

The white guards hurry after her. One slows down as they pass you, but Lars jerks his head up and grins widely. You glance his way and show off all your teeth as well. Then the guard nods and leaves. 

Weird. Plain. Weird. 

And the Tower has some messy havoc powers. You sit up.

“The Untouchables rule over the Cups.16 South’s parallels starting from 1300,” mumbles Lars. He sits on the sidewalk and stares in the direction the Tower and those officers have left. “They don’t mess with the Unspeakables, some disregard those even exist. The Unspeakables’ front mouths are sewn at birth, and the Untouchables have their back mouths sewn.”

Got it. “Must grin.” You pull on the widest one possible, and now your mouth and cheeks hurt. “You know a lot, don’t you?”

“Uh-huh.” Lars doesn’t stir.

“How?”

“Uh-huh.” 

You sit next to him and try to follow his eyes. “What you’re looking at?”

Lars hunches his shoulders and looks down at his lap. “N-nothing.”

Glass and metal skyscrapers tower on that side of the bridge. Shambles and garbage pile up below it. 

“So… the Tower’s breaking the law by sneaking in here?”

“Uh-huh.” Lars fiddles with his fingers.

Great. You broke him.

“The Tower is a destruction card,” whispers Lars and won’t look up. “Their special power is accidents. Unexpected change.” He presses his palm to the glass border.

“So she’s a bad guy? A reversed card?”

Lars shakes his head. “The Tower’s not always damage. Just… change.”

Well, that’s enough of change for you. Those sharp teeth at the back of their heads and stitched mouths were something. Jeez– Not that you’re scared. 

You get up. “Shall we?”

Lars hesitates but nods in the end.
