#### Intro

Intro. On the Hermit’s Mission

“You!” Theodore Jansen snarls and kicks the chair. It clatters away, and Theodore throws off everything from his desk. He paces the small room. “I hate everything about you!” 

Theodore stops and stares at his own pale reflection in the mirror. He hardly blinks, and his hands tremble as he pulls down the black hood. It’s almost dark but for the candle behind him, and shadows play on the stone walls. 

Alone. Still. Theodore breathes so quietly. 

“Fuck…” His amber eye twitches. Theodore leans in but still sees no reds inside. He jerks his hand up and pinches his finger – nothing. No magicks churn under his skin. “How did I even… like… ugh.” Theodore looks himself up and down and tightens his lips into a thin line. “Like this.”

Theodore’s broken. He has been for the past hundred years, and Gleb has everything and nothing to do with it.

Leven, it means life. Theodore clutches and opens his fist. He didn’t pass the aptitude test to enter the Union’s most elite academy – he wrecked it. He was ten, and his potential power broke the scale… 

Perhaps, that was a sign. Yet at that time, Theodore was proud, his whole family was. Theodore was proclaimed to become the most powerful wielder his esteemed and noble lineage has ever produced. 

Theodore digs his nails into his palm so hard, it should draw blood. 

But it doesn’t.

Leven means life. Only one received the legendary name thought the Union’s history, and that was Theodore’s great-great and some more grandfather. The greatest blood wielder of all, the blood Magicks founder. He was also the one to establish the academy and create the scale. Which implied that one day Theodore could grow stronger than him.

Theodore smiles at himself in the mirror and huffs a laugh. His face is all wrong and twisted. Broken. He’s broken.

Problems arose soon enough. It was easy to hide it behind the Jansens’ estates walls but at the academy… At the academy, they started talking. Behind his back, everybody was too afraid to go anywhere near a Jansen. His magicks were slipping. Whenever he would get angry, those would lash out and wreak havoc. 

But then he had the power. And now, well, he doesn’t. He’s broken.

“Bleeding mess,” Theodore swears and smashes the mirror. It shatters, glass shards cut into his skin and scatter around the floor. Theodore rolls his head back and laughs. Blood streams down his wrist and drips on the black robe. 

He feels it now. However faint, that’s his magicks pulsating in every drop.

This started after the duel against Gleb. Theodore lost the two Kings, sure, the blow was so powerful they didn’t even get reversed first. But Theodore landed one of his own, that should have finished the Black Emperor for good. 

It was Theodore’s fate, he knew it from the second he first saw the Black Emperor. Gleb swept off a whole parallel. There was a world, and a moment later, there wasn’t, and the neighbouring parallels patched up around the hole. As if nothing has happened. Theodore knew he would stop the Black Emperor. Either that or Gleb destroys the four realms at his own whim.

Theodore feels weak. His vision hazes, and he sways. Glass crunches under his sneakers. He swears a lengthy string in a dead language, picked it up in Limbo, the same way as Theo did. They were one and the same, so–

“How does this even happen?” rasps Theodore and slowly lowers himself to his knees.

Theodore found the sword at fourteen, slashed a gash to Limbo, and got sucked inside. Escaped, learnt about the cards, got the King of Pentacles and, at that point, run into Gleb. His fate, his mission. Fights, sneak attacks and skirmish, Theodore was mastering to control the cards’ powers and preparing for the ultimate battle. 

Theodore Leven Jansen had the most blood magicks inside of him, the King of Swords legendary sword and the King of Pentacles star, which controls the state of things. 

And with all that he lost. He challenged Gleb with the two Kings against his Emperor, thought they’d be enough with his magicks and didn’t bet the Hermit’s card as well. By the duel rules, only one of them could leave. Either Theodore or Gleb, the circle formed an invisible bubble around the glade. 

They fought. They injured each other. It was their usual game, their bodies healed, and yet this time the stakes were higher. The game had to end. Theodore’s magicks slipped out of control, they lashed out– 

They struck at the same time. 

Pain. 

A nuance, a tiny coincidence that the duel circle broke when the blow ripped out Theodore’s two kings. They floated into the abyss right away, Theodore couldn’t see what happened to the Emperor’s card. 

The duel ended, and yet Theodore wouldn’t heal. His wound was so deep, that the Hermit’s card reversed. Theodore passed out, and when he woke up, he was alone. He was absolutely sure his magicks hit Gleb. He was absolutely sure he’s won.

For about a month. 

Theodore crumbles to the floor and turns to lie on his back. He sprawls out his arms, the glass shards cut his skin. Some touch the inside of his sleeves and fall through into the nothingness. The Hermit’s power is his robe, and that has the appetite of a black hole.

“Fuck.”

That month bothered the wits out of him. Only the new owner of the card could remember the previous one, others should have forgotten all about Gleb. But they didn’t, and Theodore himself still recalled the faint blue glow of Gleb’s eyes. Theodore, definitely, didn’t have the Emperor’s card.

“He had to be somewhere out there,” whispers Theodore and raises his hand. The candle flickers and shadows dance around his fingers. “One hundred and sixteen years. He had to be.” Theodore never doubted Gleb would return. “But I was broken.” He laughs and snatches up a glass shard. “Shattered.” Theodore tosses it away, and the mirror smashes into even smaller pieces.

His magicks never replenished after that. No matter how hard Theodore tried, he couldn’t conjure the most simple sigil. He couldn’t feel the power that used to course under his skin. His blood would react, if only a little, when he flew off the handle.

“I was so happy when it slipped the first time. Proved it was still inside me.” Theodore smiles and closes his eyes. He chuckles. The corner of his lips twitches. “Fucking idiot. Nothing changed, I still had no control over my magicks but now have the potential… of a kindergarten kid.” 

Since then, Theodore has learnt to keep his temper. 

“Pathetic. A laughing matter. Good thing, my parallel faded around that time. No one got to see a Jansen this weak. Disgusting.”

Theodore was broken, he depleted his blood potential. His weakest magicks were utterly out of control. The Hermit’s powers were contaminated. And to top all that, the Black Emperor was somewhere out there. 

So, Theodore started looking. It had to be another Theodore Jansen against Gleb then. 

Took him over a hundred to find one. The same one. The right one. Across all the parallels, Theodore sought out hundreds of variations and probabilities. This Theodore Jansen was exactly as powerful as he used to be. He only needed to play his cards, well, the only card he had left, right.

Theo found the sword at fourteen, slashed a gash to Limbo, and got sucked inside. Learnt about the cards, escaped… Tracking down the King of Swords turned out easy, but Theodore hasn’t seen the King of Pentacles ever since. The King of Wands would have to do, as, luckily, inside Limbo Theo came across their very injured Queen. 

Theo became the King of Wands, and sooner or later would have to face Gleb. A Theodore Jansen’s fate. His mission to take down the evil. 

Gleb showed up a bit too early. It didn’t disrupt Theodore’s plan, not much. He’d train Theo to use the sword and sceptre, and then give him a little boost with the Hermit’s robe. They were similar, and Theodore has moulded Theo’s life that way so that they were the same. Over the hundred and sixteen years, Theodore’s thought of every tiny detail. 

Perhaps except one. And Theo did that one thing.

“Two separate lives,” Theodore mouths silently and stares at the ceiling. 

Theo rebelled and split their fate into two. 

“It was supposed to be one. His.” 

The candle flickers. Quietly, Theodore’s heart thuds on.

“I’m corrupted. Broken. I should be dead.”

But now Theodore’s still alive, and he has no idea how he feels about it. Or what to do with his life. Or even what to do tomorrow for that matter.

Theodore Leven Jansen has never felt that lost before.





Chapter 1

“Weird.” You tap your fingers against the window and try to make out anything outside. All the flowers closed their buds for the night. The lawn melts into the clouds. “Huh.”

Apparently, the Black Castle sits on a floating island, and that is also a parallel of its own. This small patch of land cuts in between two larger parallels somewhere in Pentacles. 1221 East. The degree and probability rate are also huge, that means the Black Castle is on the outskirts of the Pentacles realm, close to the Swords border, and tilts up over the rift. Like a bridge.

“And time goes under the bridge,” you whisper and press your cheek to the glass. It’s just cool outside, while inside the castle, the Black Emperor lights up at least several fireplaces. He has an odd passion for those. “This way you age very slow even if you stay here all the time. A full day might tot up to months outside.” 

Or so the Black Emperor says. It has been night for at least two days now. 

You you have to idea what you’re doing here. The Black Emperor, the master evil, all-mighty and destroyer of whole worlds, etc., etc., treats you like a guest. Alice either wrinkles her nose, stomps and occasionally snarks or completely ignores you. She might be blind, but her ribbons flutter every time, so she could have as well acknowledged you were near. Instead, she accidentally steps onto your foot, elbows you in the stomach, or drops random stuff. Lars has it better, Alice just fails to notice him. 

“Why are they still here?!”

You wince as her shriek pierces the hall. Don’t really have time to get out, the Black Emperor’s heavy footsteps echo down the corridor. He hurries from the west wings’ rooms and steps out into the main hall. Your breath hitches, and you force yourself to stay. Maybe they won’t see you perched on the windowsill next to the white marble stairs. Even if you’ve chosen the most obvious spot right across from the imposing front door. 

“Gleb!” Alice stomps into the hall too. Her ribbons flutter and coil in the air around her.

The Black Emperor stops– she bumps into his back, and he whirls around and catches Alice by the shoulders. His heavy black cape rustles. Your heart races, and you hold your breath to keep quiet. The Black Emperor lifts Alice up and puts her on her feet. She doesn’t struggle, and her ribbons calm down a bit. 

Alice glares up and crosses her arms over her chest. “Gleb.”

The Black Emperor and the Black Empress. Wonder what their relationship is.

He sighs and cups his left cheek so that his fingers rest on the black mask. “What?”

“I’ve told you–“

“What is the problem,” he says. 

Alice’s ribbons twitch and fold their tips pointy. None of the swarm aims directly at the Black Emperor though.

“Argh!” Alice cries out, and you hunch your shoulders. She clutches her fists and stomps. “I don’t like them! I. Don’t. Want. Them. Here.” 

The Black Emperor waits a little before he speaks, “What exactly don’t you like?”

“Them! Those two being here.”

“Why?” 

“They’re…” Alice whirls her head around, and you hug your knees tighter to your chest. Her eyes are wrapped as always, sure, but at one moment, you almost feel them graze your side. “But the Black Castle is my home, and they’re here. Duh.”

“The Black Castle is our home.” Luckily, the Black Emperor doesn’t look up the stairs. He stretches his arms and gestures around. In general, his eyes are locked on Alice.

She huffs and groans. “Fine. Our home and I don’t want them in here.”

The Black Emperor pauses again. And shrugs. “Well, I invited them to stay.” 

You can’t see his expression, yet amusement touches his voice. You even relax a little, and your heartbeat steadies. But better remain curled up into a ball on the windowsill and squeeze yourself further into the corner. Just in case any of them spots you eavesdropping.

Alice sighs. She waves, and the ribbons soften and carefully wrap back around her arms. “And why did you do that?”

“They…” the Black Emperor traces off and runs his hand through his short hair. “They were not scared of me, I guess. I mean, look,” he leans down and taps Alice’s shoulder, “many are not scared out of their wits when they see me, you’ve noticed.” He turns her around, so that both face their backs to you now, and ushers her towards the door. Just one step, their voices carry around the hall clearly. “But that’s because I’ve been gone for so long, few seem to remember about me.”

“Duh.” Alice doesn’t struggle but isn’t pleased.

“Mda,” agrees the Black Emperor and adds quickly, “which annoys me, and I’m correcting that soon enough. Getting there. Look, they know, well, the little guy knows for sure what I am.”

Alice looks up at him, and one ribbon slips off her wrist. It rises up to her face, floats by her side and mimics the movement.

“What we are, what reversed cards are.” The Black Emperor gestures and puts his palm on Alice’s back. “And he doesn’t care. Lars asked me to help because he thought I could, and then he thanked me because I did. See?” 

Huh?

“The World too–“ 

You twitch as he mentions your name. Stay. Still. Did he see you and turned Alice away, or were they going outside from the start? It’s supposed to be somewhere around early morning, the present darkness wrecked your sleeping patterns.

“…they don’t treat me like a reversed card. They treat me like,” the Black Emperor chuckles and nudges Alice to the door, “a card. Just another card, although I think they’re afraid of me. As a person, not because I’m corrupted. Besides, they don’t have anywhere else to go so–“

Alice stops in her tracks, and the Black Emperor has to do so too. 

“You pity them.”

He tenses. That looks kinda funny when he looms over Alice in his full black attire. Shrugs. 

“That wasn’t a question.” She pokes her index finger into his chest. “Do you pick up just any orphan?” She mutters something so quietly that you don’t get it. “Huh… you… do?” Alice stomps and clutches her fists. ”Don’t you!” she cries out, whirls around on her heels and runs… up the white marble stairs.

Fuck.

You jerk and crawl further into the corner, press yourself against the glass so firmly it vibrates and rings quietly. Double that.

Alice freezes after the first flight. She looks up. 

“You…” Wrapped or not, her eyes bore into your head. “You!” she snaps and throws her arms up. Her milk ribbons soar, they coil and fold their tips like daggers.

Oh-huh. Triple that. 

“Alice!” shouts the Black Emperor, and his heavy steps thud across the hall.

The Black Empress hisses, and her ribbons mimic that. The whole swarm of them aims right at you, even her long hair floats up and above her shoulders. The air cracks and thickens around her.

Ugh, run. Not again!



* * *

Alice chases you all the way around the tower. It’s how the castle’s build: the main central part has two floors, and the four towers are linked to it via a corridor for each. Too bad you didn’t think about that before. You glance back, but she’s already blocking that one corridor. 

“Get back, you idiot!” she yells. Her ribbons soar and coil around her like a swarm of hissing snakes.

You dash around the corner. It’s dark, you hardly see where you’re going. 

“I said–! Argh!” 

“A-a-h!” One ribbon grazes your shin, and you jump to the side. 

Thud! Crack!

You knock over some furniture and trip over a vase. Or some other white decor – no time to look – but it’s sharp, and a shard cuts your palm.

“This is my home, my family! I hate you!” The glass cracks as Alice runs over the shards too. “Ugh, Goddess.” Her voice sounds a little behind.

Don’t look back. Just run. You gasp for breath and push on. Over the rolled-up carpet’s edge and past the low threshold into the castle’s wing. Never mind which one is this– wait, hope it’s the one where you and Lars are staying. Another turn and rooms start on the right side. On the left are windows–

Alice shouts and growls, and her ribbons wreck random stuff and leave scratches on the walls. 

Fuck.

You’ve just looked back. Your heart skips a beat. 

Alice smirks and gestures her hand. She scoops up some air, and her ribbons pounce and mimic the movement. Down! Ouch. Pain pierces your leg, another second, the ribbons swoop over your head and turn around. Roll– They smash into the wall, and you crawl away. Your back knocks into something. A door? 

“A-ha!” Alice whirls her hand once more. “Gotcha!”

Two ribbons wrap around your leg. You jerk it and pull on the closest– ouch, the fabric burns your palm. You grind your teeth and don’t let go, and yet more ribbons tighten around your leg. They pull you across the corridor and snatch you up.

“O-wo-a-ah!” Upside down. You whirl your arms around and try to kick the ribbons. Or wrench your other leg free. Or anything.

 Alice snaps her fingers. A gush of cool air, one ribbon unhooks the window, and others yank you through the window frame. Well, at least she’s opened it first…

“A-a-h!” you shout. Darkness. You plunge, grass grows closer– And then the ribbons yank you up. “Put me down!” you plead, and your voice breaks. You rasp and suffocate. Hurts.

Alice snickers. “As you wish.” Her ribbons loosen, you slip– that’s two floors down, alright?! The ribbons tighten. They pull you up and spin around.

“Alice, stop that!” exclaims the Black Emperor. He hurries down the corridor, you see his dark figure appear in the windows one by one.

“They have to go!” whines Alice. “This is my home, not theirs!”

The Black Emperor struggles with Alice, he tries to gently pull some ribbons inside. It does nothing, he holds two, then three more unwrap from her arms and shoot towards you. They argue, and nausea clutches your throat. Your heartbeat drowns out their voices.

“W-world!”

Oh, that’s definitely Lars. All the commotion must have, finally, woken him up. You squint and spot Lars duck under Alice’s ribbons. Can’t see him well, does he climb up the windowsill?

A light blue stem crawls from his palm and over the window frame. It shimmers in the night and slowly grows out to you. You wriggle and try to reach for it– too far – still too far!

Lars pants and squeezes his eyes shut. His hand shakes, the vine vibrates and glows fainter. It grows out from his skin, across his open palm, and twines in between his fingers. 

Lars winces. He slams his wrist into the window frame, the vine steadies and shoots a few leaves.

“Just a bit more!” you shout and kick the ribbons.

Alice’s forgotten about you for now. The Black Emperor’s pulled her aside, hovers over and quietly says something. You only see the back of her dark redhead. Alice nods. Her ribbons float and hold you above the ground. By one leg and upside down, but at least they don’t pull roughly or spin you around.

“A little... bit!” You reach further and yet grab only air.

Lars grimaces and pushes his wrist down. He climbs up and crouches on the windowsill, throws his whole weight to keep his right hand in place. The light blue stem crawls out into the night. It glows so close. 

So. 

Close.

“Argh!” Lars cries out. The vine bursts. He tumbles backward and plumps onto the floor.

The ribbons let go. You yelp and plunge, the ground looms closer– 

“Alice!” that’s the Black Emperor.

Her ribbons wrap around your body. Like a spiderweb, you’re stuck, and they bounce back.

“Got them,” she grumbles and hoists you up and then through the open window.

“Umpf!” Tosses you on the floor, and you roll further and knock into the wall. 

“Don’t be rude,” chides the Black Emperor and lowers his voice. 

You see colours. Lars crawls to you, shakes your shoulder and mumbles.

“Great job, Lars,” says the Black Emperor and goes on talking to Alice quieter.

Lars flushes. “I didn’t–“

“Yeah.” Alice puts her hands on her sides. “I did.”

The Black Emperor gives her a look. Alice meets his gaze, holds it for a few moments, but then shudders and steps back. His eyes flash a deeper blue in the semidarkness. Oh. Above your heads, a torch blazes on the wall. He must’ve lit it while you were, well, loitering outside.

“Now.” The Black Emperor looks from Alice to Lars and you. He claps his hands. “How about a change of scene?”
