## Lies eine Kapitel!

#### Intro

There’s nothing special about you. 

You thought about it before but never realised with such clarity. The hundreds of you-s stare back. Same as you, a little different. Wrong hair, a darker eye colour, skinnier arms, or it can be that their favourite colour is green… 

You blink. They all look away, and you bite into your lip. You’ve been clenching your fists so tight, you no longer feel your bruised fingers. 

They hurry on. Did they see you? The thousands of mirrors thump and rattle. Some slip and shatter into the blazing greyish fog. The ground shakes, and it thunders again.

You cough on the burnt air. Ashes, dust and everything material bursts into particles and hurts your eyes. Your whole world crashes behind your back. Breathe. You throw yourself at the nearest mirror. Your fists hit the cold glass again and again. You’ve got so far. The last one of your world, you didn’t care where – ran as fast as you could to the split.

Other you-s don’t care. They don’t even hear you as you scream and beat against the unmoving glass.
“That won’t do it, kid.”

You jerk your head up and see a crooked man step out. He takes his wide-brimmed hat off and tosses it into the rubble. Then loosens his patched scarf so that it wouldn’t cover half of his face.

“Why so quiet suddenly?” croaks the man and throws away his tinted round glasses as well. His darker skin is wrinkled and scorched with scars. “They won’t let you through.” He nods at the mirrors. Some more shatter. The further ones disappear into the disintegrating particles of your world. “Not unless you are a card. Others must die when their world dies.”

You clench your teeth and stand up. “How do I get one?”

Thunder blurs the stranger’s voice as your eyes find his. Glowing blues with yellow slits for pupils. The rattle dies out, it’s still there – the ground shakes right under your feet – but for some reason, the stranger’s voice is all you can hear.

“You’re a sharp one, I see.” He huffs a laugh. “A survivor.” He leaps over as earth cracks in between you. Two arm’s length away. “You’re in luck, kid.” He smiles crookedly and reveals perfect sets of shark-like teeth. “I’ve wanted to give up mine. But it comes with a price.” 

You look back at what’s left of your world. At your bleeding hands and at the darkness rolling closer. Greyish burning air. Particles. More mirrors shatter. About twenty left. Nothingness but for the spot you are standing on.  

And then, there is this card. Whatever that is.

“I’m taking it.”

The stranger slides his gloved hand under his coat. You clench your teeth tighter and won’t stumble back. Wanted to, every feeling screaming to get away and run. Only you know too well there’s nowhere left to run. Nothingness licks at the heels of your sneakers.

The stranger’s arm disappears up to the elbow underneath his coat and into his chest. A rip, a clap, a faint glower, and he breaks into his sinister laughter once more. 

“When you take a card, you lose your soul.” The stranger’s eyes glow brighter. 

You feel the remains of your world creeping from under your feet. The last few mirrors slip. “But I’ll live… right?” Your eyes are on the only mirror left. Right behind the stranger. He can still back out of the deal and make it out alive, for what you know about loyalties. 

“Yeah. You get to live.” Slowly, he pulls out his hand, and something smoulders through his clenched fingers.

“Then I’m taking it!” you snap and pounce. The rough fabric cuts into your skin. You clench his arm and wrench the thing out from his fingers, almost pull it from him, clasped in between your palms. The stranger grasps your hands just in time.

But he doesn’t struggle to get it back. He sneers and hovers over you, his sharp teeth now so close to your face that you smell something rotten.

“Remember,” he whispers, “you lose your card, you don’t die. You crumble into dust, and poof goes the memory you’ve ever existed.” His eyes blaze a darker shade of blue. “You also get to remember the look in the eyes of the previous owner. Before evaporating.” He winks at you and closes your fingers around the card. “Ciao.” He lets go. “Won’t see you around.”

And with that, he… disappears. Thunder roars in your ears, the last of the ground cracks– Ashes slip through your fingers, hurt your scratched hands and stick to your stained clothes. A-a-ah! Dead man’s ashes – but you hear the rattle, and the last mirror starts slipping. You glance at the thing, a paper card, clenched in your fingers.

And jump. The last pieces of your world soar into nothingness behind your back.


### Chapter 1

Ugh. Your head hurts. 

“We aren’t late? Are we late? Ow!” Somebody squeaks. She has such a high-pitched voice, what a bother! “Are we, are we?”

You grimace and open your eyes. It doesn’t help much, everything’s blurry. The pale skies blind you after all the darkness and smoke, and you wince at the piercing pain.

“Are we?” repeats the girl.

Shut up. Please? You clench your fists, and yet feel nothing. Your numb fingers bleed. You wriggle your foot a little, then tilt your head to the side. Hard ground touches your scratched skin, and you bite back a yelp. 

Lying on your back, you realise in a moment. You shut your eyes hard and then blink a few times to stay awake. 

Nausea hits.

“Curse,” groans the girl, and for a second you think you’ve heard another voice. “It’s already down!” she yells. “Bet Jansen had something to do with it!” A pause, and, “Of course! Who else? It’s always Jansen. … Yes, I hate him! He’s annoying and pokes his nose where it doesn’t belong. … No, that’s a good enough reason!”
She’s talking to someone, isn’t she? You groan silently and try to sit up. Pain shots through your head and down your spine. 

Finally, you manage to peek to the side. Greyish-white and ground. Nothing else but for the two blurry figures and a larger black dot.

You lie low and hold your breath. Memories flood in flashes. School. The horrid noise. Ground cracking. Your teacher tore up into particles right in front of your eyes… Well, you never liked the hag… Right? You swallow the sigh and keep silent. 

“And who the claws are you?!” 

Fuck.

“…” You can’t hear what the other says, just that her voice is gentle and soft.

“Who. Are. You,” grits the girl and jabs her shoe into your side.

“Ompf!” You force your eyes open. 

“Anya, you’re hurting them!”

“Shut– Ugh. Argh!” The girl throws her hands up and groans. 

You blink a few times before your vision finally focuses. Freckles. Ginger hair touches her shoulders. A yellow T-shirt. 

“No, Moon,” says the girl calmer to the other behind her. “I am not.”

Dark shorts. Stupid striped socks.

“B-but–”

“No, Moon,” she insists and scuffs her green sneaker against the ground. “Moon?”

“… yes, Sun,” concedes the gentle voice, and the redhead turns and glares back at you. “But please don’t hurt them.” 

That Sun girl glances over her shoulder and hmp-s. “Fine,” she groans and rolls her head back. “Whatever. I don’t care.”

“Ouch!”

Bet she kicks your shin just in case. 

“Sun.”

“Alright. For you.” Sun steps back, and you gasp.

Two same faces. Moon kneels next to you but still not close enough. She has to reach out to touch your arm. Shoulder-length silver hair and blue eyes. Warm fingers graze your skin. A pale dress. Striped socks?
You smile, and Sun darts forward and hovers over your head.

“What’s so funny?” she snaps and pokes your head with her sneaker.

“Sun!” 

“Oh, they’re fine, Moon, don’t tit.” 

Wait, silver hair? You blink, but Moon definitely has silver-white hair and same colour bright freckles as her twin. Ugh, why bother now? That stranger had yellow slits for pupils and shark teeth, and you suddenly care for a girl to have silver hair? Makes no sense. You shut your eyes, but the stranger’s smirk won’t go away. 

“Where did you come from?” asks Moon softly, and you feel her eyes trace your every scratch and bruise.

Dead man’s ashes on your hands. Dead world’s dust in your lungs. She can’t see all that, can she? You bolt to sit up, and nausea and pain wash over you. You gasp for breath but still suffocate. 

No matter what, you keep your fists clutched. If only you could remember why… It was something important, something you’d rather nobody saw.

“I… fell in through the… mirror,” you stumble on your words. Your mind races. 

The classroom shook. The sky darkened and split. You ran. On and on, towards whatever that was while your hometown evaporated. How did that stranger call you? A survivor, huh? 

But Sun is as oblivious to your musings as you are to her rambling.

“Mirror? Which mirror– ah, you mean the portal?” She pokes your head again, but this time lightly, and points at the mirror. “That’s a portal, you dumb-ass.” Shadows swirl inside the pitch blackness on the other side. “And your world’s down, you’re lucky to be out and not inside there.”

The mirror glowers an eerie shade– you yelp and tumble.

“Ta!” snickered Sun. “Chicken.” Moon gives her a look, and Sun groans. “Oh well, your parallel’s down,” she explains and gestures. Sun looks clearly annoyed, and yet carries on in her high-pitched voice. “Destroyed, disappeared, disintegrated into particles. No big deal. Your family’s kinda dead, but it’s more like they don’t exist anymore. Everyone you knew too. Like I said…” She pats Moon on the shoulder, wraps her arms around Moon and helps her to her feet. “No big deal.” Sun turns Moon away from you and ushers her on. “Happens.”

Dead. It might be the pain dulling that it starts to sink it. Dead. No boy who kept snatching your pencil case and tossing it around. No cranky neighbour’s dog that chewed your favourite sneakers. No parents. No rules, you are free to do whatever you want…? 

Dead. Dead. Dead.

Your skin tinges, so you raise your hand to your eyes. It doesn’t glow or shimmer, or anything magical for that matter. Bummer, sure. Blue and bleeding skin. There is nothing special about you.
“What card are you?” Moon whispers.

Card? Ow. That card! The stranger’s card! You jerk forward but stop the last moment. Trust no one. Even if Moon seems nice, her twin is an ass. 

“Survivor?” That’s what the stranger’s called you. For some reason, you can remember your family’s favourite was pie but can’t recall your own name.

“There’s no such card.” Moon shakes her head.

“Moon!” 

Well, you’ve missed the part where Sun strode off and now glares from there.

“I’m coming!” calls out Moon, tucks a loose strand of her silver hair behind her ear and hurries off. You watch them leave until their figures melt into the greyish horizon. 

Sun and Moon. Weird. Was your name any better? Finger by finger, you loosen the numb grip… Only your palm is empty. Any palm.

“Wha…” you cry out but hush yourself. Turn your palms upside-down and back up, check inside your hoodie’s torn sleeves and every pocket. 

The card’s gone.
